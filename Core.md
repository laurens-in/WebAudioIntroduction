## Goals

1. You know the necessary tools to continue your journey into web audio.
2. You made a tiny piece to practice what we learned and solidify the knowledge.

This course is practically oriented, it will help you develop good theoretical positions.

## Why Web Audio

- the web is the most important technology of our time
- accessible to a large audience
- generative music becomes "mobile"
- small but dedicated community
- can help you in other ways (e.g. web programming knowledge)
