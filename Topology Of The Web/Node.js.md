Node.js is a _server-side_ runtime for JavaScript:

- it runs JavaScript outside of the browser
- similar to the browser, it provides API to access native parts of your system:
  - file-system API
  - crypto API
- made it possible to write server and client code in JavaScript
- integrates a package manager to install libraries

Because of Node.js the popularity and ecosystem of JavaScript exploded. Today people try to do everything with JavaScript, as noted by Atwood's Law:

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.
