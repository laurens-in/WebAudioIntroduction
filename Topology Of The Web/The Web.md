The **World Wide Web** (**WWW**), commonly known as **the Web**, is an [information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system "Information system") that enables information sharing over the [[Internet]] through user-friendly ways. It allows documents and other [web resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource "Web resource") to be accessed over the [[Internet]] according to specific rules of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") (HTTP).

Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") and can be accessed by programs such as [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"). Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called [uniform resource locators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator "Uniform resource locator") (URLs). The original and still very common document type is a [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") formatted in [Hypertext Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language "Hypertext Markup Language") (HTML). This markup language supports [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text"), [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image "Digital image"), embedded [video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video "Video") and [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal "Audio signal") contents, and [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language") (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports [hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink "Hyperlink") (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web resources. [Web navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation "Web navigation"), or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. [Web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application") are web pages that function as [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"). The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") (HTTP).[^1]
