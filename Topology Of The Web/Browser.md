Software to render web-pages consisting of [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] files. The browser contains different engines to handle different tasks:

- rendering the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) which is parsed from [[HTML]]
- rendering styles described in [[CSS]]
- a runtime to execute [[JavaScript]] code

It also offers interfaces to native system components or services via [[Browser APIs]].
