A website consists of at least a [[HTML]] file, but can include multiple [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] files.

The three components each have their own purpose:
- [[HTML]] describes the **structure**
- [[CSS]] describes the **appearance**
- [[JavaScript]] adds dynamic behavior and **interaction**

As an analogy, think of a factory. [[HTML]] would describe the different rooms of the building and what machines they contain. [[CSS]] would describe the look of these rooms, where the machines are located, the colors of the walls and so on. This is enough to describe our factory building, but nothing will be happening as long as there are no workers. The workers are equivalent to [[JavaScript]]: They dynamically interact with the rest of the factory to create something interesting.
