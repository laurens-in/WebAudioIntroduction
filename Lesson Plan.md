## 1. Meeting

_3 lessons_

First **adminstrative** info and such.

We will take a look at the web, the browser and audio from different angles.

**high-level, technical**: what is a browser? what is a client? what is a server? how do they interact with each other? why is the browser an attractive platform for art? what are its pros and cons? how does it compare to other alternatives?

**low-level, technical**: what is html, css, javascript? how can the browser make sound? what is the Web Audio API (also, what is an API)? what other APIs are there? what are its limitations?

We will quickly go over the most important tools for us as Web Developers e.g. git, npm, code editor, mdn web docs.

**media theory / importance of browser/web art**: what is the importance of the browser for us as artists? what are the intricacies of this environment/medium? why is it important that artists learn to code? why is it important for artists to **understand** technology.

I personally think the browser gives way to a mainstreamization of generative art/music, very similar to what industrialisation did to reproducible mediums a century ago - what Benjamin calls "Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit". I think we are now at a point where we need to think about "Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Generierbarkeit", and how it relates to aura, authenticity, authority, politics and so on. Of course this shift hasn't happend yet, but for the first time in history it is technically feasible.

## 2. Meeting

_2-3 lessons_

#### Web Programming Basics

We'll install the tools that we need to get started and create a simple webpage to get to know all the basics. What is HTML/CSS, how does it work and especially how can we interact with Javascript to do the actual programming. 

#### Javascript Basics

We'll take a closer look at Javascript: What is variable, function, object etc. ? What is static/dynamic typing? What are the pros/cons of a language like Javascript.

## 3. Meeting

_2 lessons_

#### Web Audio API / ToneJS

We'll look at the Web Audio API/ToneJS and how it works and do some experiments. We will not spend too much time on the raw Web Audio API since most students probably won't be using it. I still consider it important to know how the underlying technology works and to give students and outlook of what is possible, where they can go if ToneJs doesn't have functionality they are looking for.

## 4. Meeting

_2 lessons_

#### ToneJS (+ Web Audio API)

We'll look at ToneJS and how it works and do some experiments. This will include looking at how to incorporate ToneJS into a project and build it (how far we'll go into this depends a little bit on the students). I would also like to talk about different ways of representing musical data in code, what it means for our compositions and what some of the caveats are.

The focus of these lessons will be on representing musical events as data (what data structures can be useful, what are their caveats/limitations). 

## 5. Meeting

_2 lessons_

#### ToneJS (+ Web Audio API)

We'll look at ToneJS some more.

The more detailed contents of Meetings 3-5 will also depend on the students and their interest, I want to remain a little bit flexible to their needs.

The focus of these lessons will be on structuring time, what tools we have to do it and what difficulties arrise when structuring time with code.

## 6. Meeting

_3 lessons_

The content of this lesson will be determined by what students would like to do. We can dive deeper into on of the already discussed topics or we can look at how to get a basic hosting for their static webpage, how to use cookies, websockets, node4max, other browser apis such as MIDI, Bluetooth, Geolocation etc.

The last lesson is dedicated to looking at the assessments and discussing them.
