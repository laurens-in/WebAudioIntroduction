### Audio Worklets

`AudioWorklets` are the most powerful feature of the Web Audio API:

- implement custom DSP-code on the sample level
- create our own `AudioNodes`

---

### Audio Worklets

Is a custom `class` that implements a `process(inputs, outputs, parameters)` method:

```js
class PassthroughProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {

  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    const input = inputs[0];
    const output = outputs[0];
    for (let channel = 0; channel < input.length; ++channel) {
      const inputChannel = input[channel];
      const outputChannel = output[channel];
      for (let i = 0; i < inputChannel.length; ++i) {
        outputChannel[i] = inputChannel[i];
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
  
}

registerProcessor("passthrough-processor", PassthroughProcessor);
```

---

### Side Note

We haven't looked at `classes`. They are a way to group together data and methods. But they also serve as blueprints for how we can create certain objects (which is why e.g.  `AudioWorkletProcessor` uses it)

**Opinion**: Don't worry about classes. Classes are stupid. If you think you need a class, ask yourself if you _really_ need it. Only use them when you have to (e.g. `AudioWorkletProcessor`).

*\*Except if you like them, then use them :)*

### Audio Worklets

After we defined the processor, we can use it like this:

```js
// since we have to load this file via network we await for it to finish
await ctx.audioWorklet.addModule("path/to/worklet.js");

const passthrough = new AudioWorkletNode(ctx, "passthrough-processor");

passthrough.connect(masterGain);
```

Let's look at an example
