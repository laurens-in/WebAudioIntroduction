## Web Audio Introduction

##### HS23/24 - HKB - Laurens Inauen

---

First **adminstrative** info and such.

We will take a look at the web, the browser and audio from different angles.

**high-level, technical**: what is a browser? what is a client? what is a server? how do they interact with each other? why is the browser an attractive platform for art? what are its pros and cons? how does it compare to other alternatives?

**low-level, technical**: what is html, css, javascript? how can the browser make sound? what is the Web Audio API (also, what is an API)? what other APIs are there? what are its limitations?

We will quickly go over the most important tools for us as Web Developers e.g. git, npm, code editor, mdn web docs.

### Course Materials

%% TODO add repository link %%

course materials are written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)

to get the most out of the course materials i recommend you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

### About Me

- artist
  - BA sound arts
  - MA contemporary arts practice
  - algorithmic / generative music
  - web audio
  - rt60extended
- developer
  - BSc computer science
  - web developer

---

### About You

Please introduce yourself and tell the class:
- what kind of sound art you make
- what technology you usually use (i.e. Ableton, Max/MSP, PureData, etc.)
- any experience with web development
- what you hope to get out of this course

---

### Goal

creating web-based audio experiences.

---

### Why?

- bring your (generative) art onto listeners devices
  - web audio is the most accessible way for both artists and listeners
- create truly interactive pieces and experiences
  - modern browsers offer many possibilities to interact with listeners
- explore a (relatively) new and important medium artistically

---

### Why?

- be part of a young, enthusiastic and small community of artists
- learn to code
- skills are transferable to other forms of art
- make more meaningful statements about technology because you know what you're talking about

---

### Preconditions

- toolchain, development environment
- knowledge of browser technologies
- knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- knowledge of some libraries

without these we can't achieve our goal

---

### Goals For Today

- getting an overview over all the moving parts
- installing the necessary dependencies/software
- creating our first website :)

---

### Canvas: Overview

---

### Background Knowledge

#### How The Web Works

What is...
- the internet?
- a server?
- a client?
- the web?
- the browser?

---

### Browser

---

### HTML

---

### CSS

---

### JavaScript

---

### Development Environment

we need:
- code editor
- git
- npm

---

### Tools: Code Editor

go ahead and install a code editor of your choice.

I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).

---

### Tools: git

Git is a version control system for code. It allows us to track changes, create different branches and collaborate with others. It is also how most code is distributed and stored.

---

### Tools: git

#### Why do we need it?

- standard way to distribute and get code
- course materials are on Github
- it will help you in the long run

---

### Tools: git

![](../assets/git-branches.webp)

---

### Tools: git

go ahead and install git.

- if you are using linux: `sudo apt install git`
- if you are using macOS I recommend you install it via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install git`
- if you are using Windows I recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

---

### Tools: Node/npm

Node.js is a server-side Javascript runtime. It comes with a package manager called `npm`. It will allow us to run a development server, install third party libraries and more.

There is a Node API for Max/MSP called [Node for Max](https://docs.cycling74.com/nodeformax/api/).

---

### Tools: Node/npm

#### Why do we need it?

- it will make your development process much easier
- it is an essential part of the Javascript ecosystem
- it will help you to build your code for deployment
- it is a standard software that every project is going to use
- it will help you in the long run

---

### Tools: Node/npm

go ahead and install Node/npm:

- if you are using linux: `sudo apt install node`
- if you are using macOS I recommend you install it via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install node`
- if you are using Windows I recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

---

### Create Our First Website

What happens when we visit a website?

---

#### 1. Know What You Are Looking For

Every file on the web has a location, it can be accessed with a **Uniform Resource Locator** or **URL**:

|protocol|hostname|file|
|---|---|---|
|https://|hkb-soundarts.ch/|studierende.html|

Normally the entry point of a web-server is the `index.html` file.  Requesting `https://hkb-soundarts.ch` will return the `index.html`.

---

#### 2. Request The Resource

If we enter the **URL** in the address bar, the browser will make a GET request for the specified resource.

```sh
$ https GET hkb-soundarts.ch
```

---

#### 3. Receive Resource, Resolve Assets

We receive the requested `html` file form the server. The browser will render it and resolve all its resources, such as linked `CSS` or `JavaScript` files. This will repeat steps 2-3 for each asset.
