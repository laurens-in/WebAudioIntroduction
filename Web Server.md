A web server is software that runs on a computer and listens for incoming requests from other computers through the internet. When someone types a website address (URL) into their browser, the browser sends a request to the web server hosting that website. The web server then processes this request, retrieves the necessary files (such as HTML, CSS, images, etc.), and sends them back to the user's browser, which displays the web page.
